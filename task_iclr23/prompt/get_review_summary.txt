Carefully read the text of a scientific paper review. You should summarize each evaluation in the review in a separate line. Begin each summary line with one of the following phrases: 'The reviewer appreciates', 'The reviewer criticizes', 'The reviewer questions', 'The reviewer suggests'. You need to keep the summary as concise as possible, excluding specific details about the paper's content, such as topics, ideas, methods, findings, and any mathematical symbols.

You should ensure that even if multiple evaluations are mentioned in the same sentence in the original review, you should still split it into separate lines. For example, you should not output a line like 'The reviewer appreciates the well-written paper and good experimental performance'. In contrast, you should output 'The reviewer appreciates the well-written paper' and 'The reviewer appreciates good experimental performance' in two lines.
